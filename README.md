# SnapDevelopHelper

lets say, you have this table:

when you export this table in [SnapDevelop](https://docs.appeon.com/snapdevelop2019/), with this settings:

<img src="https://github.com/tuke307/SnapDevelopHelper/blob/master/pic/snapdevelop_export_settings.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

you get this result;

snapdevelop dont export your comments!!! with my tool you can add your comments above the property. If you want, you can also change the datatypes to more common used ones. you can also set the properties to nullable ones! feel free to play with the settings!
